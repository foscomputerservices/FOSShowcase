FOSShowcase contains a number of applications that showcase the Open Source technologies developed by [David Hunt](www.linkedin.com/in/davidhun) of [FOS Comoputer Services, LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fos-computer-services).  It demonstrates how to use [Swift](https://swift.org) to build an M-V-VM full-stack suite of applications:

- [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/)-based [Backend Web Server](https://www.focomputerservices.com) deployed on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite)-based [Web Front End](https://www.focomputerservices.com)
- [iOS Application]()
- [iPadOS Application]()
- [macOS Application]()
- [watchOS Application]()
- [tvOS Application]()
- [visionOS Application]()
- [Skip](https://skip.tools)-based [Android Application]()

## Alpha Stability Warning

Please note that these libraries are currently a work in progress.  The APIs are rapidly evolving and while the overall architecture is set, breaking changes will occur until 1.0 is released.  The documentation is evolving, but the 'Getting Started' guidance is incomplete.  Nonetheless, the implementations are stable and unit tests are in place to ensure proper code coverage and stability of all publicly-facing APIs.  This warning will remain in place until I feel that these limitations are remedied.  Please log any issues that you might find or suggestions for improvements.

FOSShowcaseWebServer is the web service backend that supports the various front end applications.
